# 🚀 Automated Redeploy

I've opened the Netlify Drop page and your Desktop folder for you!

## Quick Steps:

1. **Netlify Drop page should be open in your browser**
2. **Desktop folder should be open in Finder**
3. **Drag the `Design_Nubank_v1.1` folder** from Desktop onto the Netlify Drop page
4. **Wait** for upload to complete (1-2 minutes)
5. **Done!** Your updated presentation is live

## Alternative: Use the Zip File

If you prefer, drag `Design_Nubank_v1.1_updated.zip` instead of the folder.

## What's Being Deployed:

✅ Fullscreen CSS - removes black borders
✅ Fullscreen JavaScript - ensures full browser window fill
✅ Optimized for 1920x1080p resolution
✅ All original presentation files

---

## After Deployment:

Your site will be live at:
- `https://nubankcase.netlify.app` (or new URL if new deployment)
- `https://lavis.work/nubankcase` (once custom domain is configured)

The presentation will now fill the entire browser window! 🎉
